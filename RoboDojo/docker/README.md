# Run RoboDojo in Docker

This image is the **RoboDojo simulation-evaluation side** — Isaac Sim 5.1,
IsaacLab, CuRobo, the RoboDojo Python stack, and the lightweight XPolicyLab client
used by `src/eval_client`. It contains **no policy, policy dependencies, or
checkpoints**: your **policy server runs outside the container** and the sim
client talks to it over the default WebSocket transport (`protocol: ws` in
`deploy.yml`), so one image can evaluate any policy.

- Base image: `nvidia/cuda:12.8.1-cudnn-devel-ubuntu22.04` (Ubuntu 22.04 + CUDA 12.8)
- Conda env inside the image: `RoboDojo` (Python 3.11)
- Project root inside the container: `/workspace/RoboDojo`

## TL;DR

On a machine with an NVIDIA GPU (driver ≥ 570):

```bash
sudo bash docker/install_docker_nvidia.sh   # one-time: Docker + NVIDIA Container Toolkit
newgrp docker                               # (or log out/in) so docker works without sudo
bash docker/smoke_docker.sh run             # build the image, run a demo eval, assert PASS
```

The last command prints a per-phase `PASS/FAIL` table and writes a result file.
(Step 4 uses the bundled demo server, which needs the native `RoboDojo` env. No
native env? Build the image and jump to [step 5](#5-evaluate-your-own-policy).)

Everything below explains each step and how to plug in your own policy.

## 1. Prerequisites

| Need | Details |
| --- | --- |
| NVIDIA GPU + driver | Driver `570.x` or newer (required by CUDA 12.8). Check with `nvidia-smi`. |
| Disk space | The image is very large (~200 GB with all Isaac Sim extensions cached) and the build cache adds more — keep **300 GB+** free. |
| OS | Linux (tested on Ubuntu 22.04). |
| Assets | The RoboDojo `Assets/` directory on the host (downloaded by `scripts/init_assets.sh`); it is mounted at run time, not baked into the image. |

## 2. Install Docker + the NVIDIA Container Toolkit

If Docker and the toolkit already work with `--gpus all`, skip to step 3.

The bundled installer sets up Docker Engine, the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, the
`nvidia` runtime, and adds you to the `docker` group:

```bash
sudo bash docker/install_docker_nvidia.sh
newgrp docker      # or log out and back in
```

Verify the GPU is visible inside a container:

```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:12.8.1-cudnn-devel-ubuntu22.04 nvidia-smi
```

You should see your GPU listed. If not, see [Troubleshooting](#6-troubleshooting).

> **China networks:** the installer auto-detects a restricted network and switches
> to TUNA/USTC apt mirrors + Docker Hub registry mirrors. Force it with
> `USE_CN_MIRRORS=1` (or disable with `USE_CN_MIRRORS=0`). Details in
> [Appendix B](#appendix-b-china-networks).

## 3. Build the image

From the repository root:

```bash
docker build -t robodojo:cuda12.8 .
```

- The **first build takes ~1 hour** (it downloads Isaac Sim and compiles CuRobo's
  CUDA kernels). Later builds reuse the layer cache and are fast.
- Headless RTX rendering works out of the box — the required libraries and a
  single Vulkan ICD are baked in (see [Appendix A](#appendix-a-configuration-reference)).
- `smoke_docker.sh run` (step 4) builds the image for you, so you can skip this
  step if you go straight there.

> **China networks:** `smoke_docker.sh` passes the right mirror `--build-arg`s
> automatically. For a manual build, see [Appendix B](#appendix-b-china-networks).

## 4. Run the demo evaluation

The fastest way to confirm the whole loop works is the bundled end-to-end check:

```bash
bash docker/smoke_docker.sh run
```

It runs, in order: GPU-in-container → image build → start the bundled `demo_policy`
server → a real container eval → assert the result file. A final table reports
each phase, and results land under `eval_result/`.

`demo_policy` is a zero-action dummy, so `success_rate: 0.0` is **expected** — the
point is that the pipeline renders, talks to the policy over WebSocket, steps the sim,
checks the reward, and writes a valid result:

```json
{ "success_rate": 0.0, "eval_time": 1, "score": 0.0, "details": { "0": { "success": false } } }
```

Watch progress live from a second terminal with `bash docker/smoke_docker.sh monitor`.

> **Note:** `smoke_docker.sh` launches the demo server **on the host** using the
> native `RoboDojo` conda env (from `scripts/install.sh`). If you don't have the
> native env and only want Docker, skip this step and go to
> [step 5](#5-evaluate-your-own-policy), pointing the eval at any policy server you
> run yourself — the demo server is only a convenience.

## 5. Evaluate your own policy

The container is the simulator side; you run the **policy server** yourself and the
container connects over WebSocket (`protocol: ws`, same as `deploy.yml`).

**5.1 — Start your policy server** (outside the container). Bind it to `0.0.0.0`
(all interfaces), not `127.0.0.1`, so a container can reach it. See
[XPolicyLab](../XPolicyLab/README.md) for policy servers.

**5.2 — Run the eval** in the container, pointing `--policy-host`/`--policy-port`
at your server:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --gpus all --network host --ipc host \
  -v "$PWD/Assets:/workspace/RoboDojo/Assets:ro" \
  -v "$PWD/Assets:$PWD/Assets:ro" \
  -v "$PWD/eval_result:/workspace/RoboDojo/eval_result" \
  -v "$HOME/.cache/warp:/root/.cache/warp" \
  -v "$HOME/.local/share/ov:/root/.local/share/ov" \
  -v "$HOME/.cache/ov:/root/.cache/ov" \
  robodojo:cuda12.8 \
  bash scripts/robodojo.sh client \
    --task stack_bowls \
    --policy-name GR00T_N17 \
    --policy-host 127.0.0.1 --policy-port 9999 \
    --ckpt <your_ckpt> --eval-num 1
```

Required client flags: `--task`, `--policy-name` (a directory under
`XPolicyLab/policy/`), `--policy-host`, `--policy-port`. Common options: `--ckpt`,
`--eval-num N` (or `native`), `--action-type` (default `ee`), `--env-gpu` (default
`0`). Add `--dry-run` to print the resolved command without launching anything.

**Mounts explained** (the last three are strongly recommended — they prevent slow
first starts):

| Mount | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `Assets → /workspace/RoboDojo/Assets:ro` | Robot/object/layout/material assets (not baked into the image). |
| `Assets → $PWD/Assets:ro` (same host path) | curobo configs bake **absolute host paths**; this second mount makes them resolve. See [Troubleshooting](#6-troubleshooting). |
| `eval_result → …/eval_result` | Persist results on the host. |
| `~/.cache/warp` | Reuse CuRobo's compiled kernels (else it recompiles for minutes on every start). |
| `~/.local/share/ov`, `~/.cache/ov` | Reuse Isaac Sim extensions/shaders (else Kit may stall pulling them). |

### Networking: where is your policy server?

| Policy server location | Run mode | `--policy-host` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Same host as the container | `--network host` | `127.0.0.1` |
| Same host, bridge network | `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` | `host.docker.internal` |
| Another machine | default networking | that machine's IP / hostname |

`localhost` inside a **bridge** container is the container itself, not the host —
this is the #1 reason "the simulator can't reach the policy server." The `client`
command checks that the policy server port is reachable before the WebSocket
handshake and prints guidance if the server is unreachable.

## 6. Troubleshooting

**GPU not visible (`nvidia-smi` fails in a container).** The NVIDIA Container
Toolkit isn't active. Re-run `sudo bash docker/install_docker_nvidia.sh`, then
`sudo systemctl restart docker`.

**"Cannot reach the policy server."** Make sure the server binds `0.0.0.0`, and
match the networking table in step 5. Quick check inside the container:
`nc -vz <host> <port>`.

**First eval seems to hang for minutes (high CPU, low GPU).** A fresh container
recompiles CuRobo's Warp kernels and/or pulls Isaac Sim extensions. Mount the host
caches (step 5) so both are reused. `smoke_docker.sh` does this automatically.

**`ValueError: /abs/host/.../X5A.urdf is not a file`.** curobo robot configs
(`Assets/Robots/**/curobo.yml`, generated by
`utils/update_embodiment_config_path.py`) bake in absolute host paths. Mount
`Assets/` a second time at its original host path (step 5), both read-only.
`smoke_docker.sh` does this automatically.

**Tiled cameras hang on the first rendered frame.** Already fixed in the image
(see [Appendix A](#appendix-a-configuration-reference)); make sure you run with
`--gpus all`.

## Appendix A: Configuration reference

**`smoke_docker.sh` env toggles**

| Env | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `ROBODOJO_SKIP_BUILD=1` | Reuse the existing image (skip the ~1 h build) — fast iteration. |
| `ROBODOJO_CN_MIRRORS=1/0` | Force China build mirrors on/off (default `auto`). |
| `ROBODOJO_SMOKE_TASK`, `ROBODOJO_SMOKE_PORT`, `ROBODOJO_SMOKE_POLICY`, … | Override task/port/policy/etc. (see the script header). |

**Volumes**

| Mount | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `-v "$PWD/Assets:/workspace/RoboDojo/Assets:ro"` | Assets (required at runtime, not baked). |
| `-v "$PWD/Assets:$PWD/Assets:ro"` | Resolve absolute host paths baked into curobo configs. |
| `-v "$PWD/eval_result:/workspace/RoboDojo/eval_result"` | Persist per-task eval artifacts on the host. |
| `-v "$HOME/.cache/warp:/root/.cache/warp"` (and `~/.local/share/ov`, `~/.cache/ov`, `~/.cache/nvidia`, `~/.nv`) | Isaac Sim / CuRobo caches — recommended for fast, offline-friendly starts. |
| `-e ROBODOJO_USD_ASSET_PREFIX=/path -v /host/usd:/path` | Point at a local Isaac Sim USD asset mirror (optional). |

**GPU selection.** `--gpus all` exposes every GPU; pin one with
`--gpus '"device=0"'`. Choose the Isaac Sim device with `--env-gpu ID`.

**Headless RTX (already handled).** Tasks render tiled cameras through Isaac Sim's
RTX path. The image bakes in `libxt6` (needed by Isaac Sim's MaterialX render
libs) and pins a **single Vulkan ICD** via `ENV VK_ICD_FILENAMES` /
`VK_DRIVER_FILES` (the toolkit also injects one at run time; two ICDs for the same
GPU wedge RTX init on the first frame). This requires `--gpus all` and
`NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all` (set by default).

**Build args.** `CUDA_IMAGE` (base image), plus the China mirrors `UBUNTU_MIRROR`,
`PIP_INDEX_URL`, `MINICONDA_URL`, `CONDA_CHANNEL_MIRROR` (see the `Dockerfile`
header and [Appendix B](#appendix-b-china-networks)).

**Validate the image without a policy server**

```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all --network host --ipc host \
  -v "$PWD/Assets:/workspace/RoboDojo/Assets:ro" \
  robodojo:cuda12.8 \
  bash scripts/robodojo.sh doctor --skip-policy
```

## Appendix B: China networks

Everything auto-detects a restricted network; these are the manual knobs.

**Host install** (`install_docker_nvidia.sh`) — auto-uses TUNA (Docker CE) + USTC
(NVIDIA toolkit) apt mirrors and sets Docker Hub registry mirrors in
`/etc/docker/daemon.json`. Force with `USE_CN_MIRRORS=1`, disable with
`USE_CN_MIRRORS=0`.

**Image build** — `smoke_docker.sh` sets the mirror build-args when it detects (or
is told, via `ROBODOJO_CN_MIRRORS=1`) a China network. For a manual `docker build`:

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg UBUNTU_MIRROR=mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn \
  --build-arg PIP_INDEX_URL=https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple \
  --build-arg MINICONDA_URL=https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh \
  --build-arg CONDA_CHANNEL_MIRROR=https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda \
  -t robodojo:cuda12.8 .
```
