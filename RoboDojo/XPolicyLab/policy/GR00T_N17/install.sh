# are not shipped. `uv sync` therefore fails to lock on an x86_64 GPU host because it
# must resolve the (missing) aarch64 wheels. We instead create the venv and use
# `uv pip install -e .`, which resolves only for the *current* platform (x86_64) and
# honors [tool.uv.sources] / [[tool.uv.index]] while ignoring required-environments.
