`FastWAM` is the XPolicyLab/RoboDojo adapter for the corresponding policy. It keeps integration-facing scripts at this directory level and leaves the original or vendored implementation in the nested source tree when present.

## Installation

What it does: installs or activates the policy-side runtime so the XPolicyLab server can import the adapter and upstream model code.

Read `INSTALLATION.md` before first use. It is intentionally kept because this policy has setup that `install.sh` cannot fully express, such as external checkpoints, system packages, manual fallback steps, or multi-environment runtime notes.

Parameters used by the command:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `policy_env` | Name of the conda environment used by the policy runtime. |

```bash
cd XPolicyLab/policy/FastWAM
# Example: install dependencies for the FastWAM policy adapter.
bash install.sh
# Example: activate the environment used later as <policy_conda_env>.
conda activate <policy_env>  # e.g. fastwam
```

## Model Training

What it does: starts the policy-specific training recipe through the XPolicyLab wrapper and writes checkpoints under this adapter directory. Training expects a prepared LeRobot v2.1 dataset under `data/<dataset_id>/lerobot/` and a matching T5 text embedding cache under `FastWAM/data/text_embeds_cache/xpolicylab/<dataset_id>/`. See `TRAINING.md` for upstream data preparation steps.

Parameters used by the command:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `bench_name` | Benchmark or dataset family, usually `RoboDojo`. |
| `ckpt_name` | Training/data run identifier, for example `cotrain`. The generated checkpoint directory appends bench, env, action, and seed. |
| `env_cfg_type` | Robot/environment configuration, for example `arx_x5`. |
| `action_type` | Action representation, for example `joint`. |
| `seed` | Random seed. |
| `gpu_id` | GPU id or comma-separated GPU ids for the policy trainer. |
| `num_gpus` | Optional explicit process count; inferred from comma-separated `gpu_id` when omitted. |

```bash
cd XPolicyLab/policy/FastWAM
# Template: train a policy run on one GPU or a GPU list.
bash train.sh <bench_name> <ckpt_name> <env_cfg_type> <action_type> <seed> <gpu_id>

# Example: train a cotrain run on four GPUs.
bash train.sh RoboDojo cotrain arx_x5 joint 0 0,1,2,3
```

The usual checkpoint directory is `checkpoints/<bench_name>-<ckpt_name>-<env_cfg_type>-<action_type>-<seed>/`. During evaluation, `ckpt_name` may be the short run name from training (auto-combined into that directory name), the full run-directory name, or a path to a checkpoint directory.

FastWAM's upstream model is large; multi-GPU training is recommended. The wrapper defaults to `FASTWAM_BATCH_SIZE=8`, but you may still need to lower it or increase the GPU count depending on available memory.

## Deployment and Evaluation

What it does: serves the policy through XPolicyLab and connects it to a RoboDojo evaluation client. Use `eval.sh` for a same-machine smoke test, or split server/client scripts for debugging and multi-machine evaluation.

Parameters used by `eval.sh`:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `bench_name` | Benchmark or dataset family, usually `RoboDojo`. |
| `task_name` | RoboDojo simulation task to evaluate, for example `stack_bowls`. |
| `ckpt_name` | Full checkpoint/run directory name under `checkpoints/`, for example `RoboDojo-cotrain-arx_x5-joint-0`. |
| `env_cfg_type` | Robot/environment configuration, for example `arx_x5`. |
| `action_type` | Action representation, for example `joint`. |
| `seed` | Evaluation seed. |
| `policy_gpu_id` | GPU used by the policy server. |
| `env_gpu_id` | GPU used by the RoboDojo simulation client. |
| `policy_conda_env` | Conda environment for the policy server. |
| `eval_env_conda_env` | Conda environment for RoboDojo simulation/client. |

```bash
cd XPolicyLab/policy/FastWAM
# Template: run same-machine policy server and RoboDojo environment client.
bash eval.sh <bench_name> <task_name> <ckpt_name> <env_cfg_type> <action_type> <seed> <policy_gpu_id> <env_gpu_id> <policy_conda_env> <eval_env_conda_env>

# Example: evaluate a trained cotrain checkpoint on stack_bowls.
bash eval.sh RoboDojo stack_bowls RoboDojo-cotrain-arx_x5-joint-0 arx_x5 joint 0 0 0 <policy_conda_env> <eval_env_conda_env>
```

| `policy_server_ip` | IP or hostname that the environment client uses to reach the policy server. |
| `additional_info` | Comma-separated runtime overrides passed to the eval client, for example `ckpt_name=...,action_type=joint`. |

```bash
cd XPolicyLab/policy/FastWAM
# Terminal 1 on the policy machine: start the policy server.
bash setup_eval_policy_server.sh \
  <bench_name> <task_name> <ckpt_name> <env_cfg_type> <action_type> <seed> \
  <policy_gpu_id> <policy_conda_env> <policy_server_port> <policy_server_host>

bash setup_eval_policy_server.sh \
  RoboDojo stack_bowls RoboDojo-cotrain-arx_x5-joint-0 arx_x5 joint 0 \

  0 <eval_env_conda_env> "ckpt_name=RoboDojo-cotrain-arx_x5-joint-0,action_type=joint" \
  5000 <policy_server_ip>
```

Set `EVAL_ENV_TYPE=debug` for offline shape/IO checks when the adapter supports it; leave it unset or set `EVAL_ENV_TYPE=sim` for RoboDojo simulation.

Frequently used environment variables detected in the adapter scripts:

| Variable | Notes |
|---|---|
| `CLEANUP` | Optional override used by the local scripts or upstream runtime. |
| `CUDA` | Optional override used by the local scripts or upstream runtime. |
| `DIFFSYNTH_MODEL_BASE_PATH` | Optional override used by the local scripts or upstream runtime. |

| `EVAL_ENV_TYPE` | Optional override used by the local scripts or upstream runtime. |
| `FASTWAM_ALLOW_DUMMY_POLICY` | Optional override used by the local scripts or upstream runtime. |
| `FASTWAM_BATCH_SIZE` | Optional override used by the local scripts or upstream runtime. |
| `FASTWAM_CHECKPOINT_PATH` | Optional override used by the local scripts or upstream runtime. |
| `FASTWAM_CKPT_ROOT` | Optional override used by the local scripts or upstream runtime. |

| `FASTWAM_DATASET_ID` | Optional override used by the local scripts or upstream runtime. |
| `FASTWAM_DATASET_STATS_PATH` | Optional override used by the local scripts or upstream runtime. |

## Notes

- Use the same logical `ckpt_name` for dataset layout and training. During evaluation, pass the generated checkpoint directory name, usually `<bench_name>-<ckpt_name>-<env_cfg_type>-<action_type>-<seed>`.
- `task_name` is only the evaluation task; multi-task checkpoints can be evaluated on different tasks without renaming the checkpoint directory.
- Use the same `action_type` for training and evaluation. The reference FastWAM path follows XPolicyLab's `pack_robot_state` / `unpack_robot_state` helpers directly and does not add policy-local `ee` pose conversion.
- Prefer running `setup_eval_policy_server.sh` and `setup_eval_env_client.sh` separately when debugging dependency, CUDA, or model-loading issues.
