# Hy_Embodied_05_VLA

**Contributor:** RoboDojo Team | **Paper:** Hy-Embodied-0.5-VLA technical report | **arXiv:** TBD | **Original code:** https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/Hy-Embodied-0.5-VLA

`Hy_Embodied_05_VLA` is the XPolicyLab/RoboDojo adapter for the corresponding policy. It keeps integration-facing scripts at this directory level and leaves the original or vendored implementation in the nested source tree when present.

## Installation

What it does: installs or activates the policy-side runtime so the XPolicyLab server can import the adapter and upstream model code.

Parameters used by the command:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `policy_uv_env` | `uv` to use `deploy.yml` `policy_uv_env_path`, or an explicit Hy-Embodied project path. |

```bash
cd XPolicyLab/policy/Hy_Embodied_05_VLA
# Example: install dependencies for the Hy_Embodied_05_VLA policy adapter.
bash install.sh
# `eval.sh` arg 9 is not a conda env. Pass `uv` or the Hy-Embodied project path.
source Hy-Embodied-0.5-VLA/.venv/bin/activate
```

## Demo Data Processing

What it does: computes `norm_stats.pkl` for the Hy-Embodied HDF5 dataset. Hy-VLA does not use a bespoke XPolicyLab HDF5-to-LeRobot converter; use the upstream Hy-Embodied data pipeline for full data collection/conversion.

`train.sh` forwards its arguments directly to the upstream
`scripts/train_robotwin_umi.sh` entrypoint. Configure the upstream-required
environment variables first, such as `HDF5_DIR`, `EXP_ROOT`, `CHIEF_IP`, and
`NPROC_PER_NODE`; the standard XPolicyLab six-argument training shape does not
apply to this adapter.

Parameters are upstream-defined by `scripts/train_robotwin_umi.sh`, not the
common XPolicyLab wrapper.

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `manifest_csv` | CSV manifest consumed by the Hy-Embodied normalization script. |
| `hdf5_dir` | Directory containing the HDF5 trajectories referenced by the manifest. |
| `output_pkl` | Output path for `norm_stats.pkl`; pass this path through `deploy.yml` or `HY_VLA_NORM_PATH`. Relative paths are resolved by the upstream script after it enters `HY_VLA_ROOT`. |
| `downsample_rate` | Optional frame downsample rate; default is `3`. |
| `chunk_size` | Optional action chunk size; default is `20`. |

```bash
cd XPolicyLab/policy/Hy_Embodied_05_VLA
# Template: compute normalization statistics.
bash process_data.sh <manifest_csv> <hdf5_dir> <output_pkl> [downsample_rate] [chunk_size]

# Example: compute norm stats for a prepared RoboDojo HDF5 manifest.
bash process_data.sh data/manifest.csv data/hdf5 Hy-VLA-RoboDojo-v3/hyvla_dojo_ckpt_v3/norm_stats.pkl 3 20
```

## Model Training

What it does: starts the policy-specific training recipe through the XPolicyLab wrapper and writes checkpoints under this adapter directory.

Parameters used by the command:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| upstream args | Arguments consumed by `scripts/train_robotwin_umi.sh`. |

```bash
cd XPolicyLab/policy/Hy_Embodied_05_VLA
# Template: pass through to the upstream Hy-Embodied training script.
HDF5_DIR=<hdf5_dir> EXP_ROOT=<output_dir> bash train.sh <upstream_args...>
```

Use the checkpoint path expected by `deploy.yml` (`ckpt_path`) during
evaluation. Relative `hy_root` and `ckpt_path` values are resolved against this
policy directory and `hy_root`, respectively. The default action type for this
adapter is `ee`.

## Deployment and Evaluation

What it does: serves the policy through XPolicyLab and connects it to a RoboDojo evaluation client. Use `eval.sh` for a same-machine smoke test, or split server/client scripts for debugging and multi-machine evaluation.

Parameters used by `eval.sh`:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `bench_name` | Benchmark or dataset family, usually `RoboDojo`. |
| `task_name` | RoboDojo simulation task to evaluate, for example `stack_bowls`. |
| `ckpt_name` | Checkpoint/run directory name. Resolution checks an explicit path, `checkpoints/`, and `Hy-VLA-RoboDojo-v3/` before falling back to `deploy.yml` `ckpt_path`. |
| `env_cfg_type` | Robot/environment configuration, for example `arx_x5`. |
| `action_type` | Action representation; default and tested path is `ee`. |
| `seed` | Evaluation seed. |
| `policy_gpu_id` | GPU used by the policy server. |
| `env_gpu_id` | GPU used by the RoboDojo simulation client. |
| `policy_uv_env` | `uv` or an explicit Hy-Embodied project path for the policy server. |
| `eval_env_conda_env` | Conda environment for RoboDojo simulation/client. |

```bash
cd XPolicyLab/policy/Hy_Embodied_05_VLA
# Template: run same-machine policy server and RoboDojo environment client.
bash eval.sh <bench_name> <task_name> <ckpt_name> <env_cfg_type> <action_type> <seed> <policy_gpu_id> <env_gpu_id> <policy_uv_env> <eval_env_conda_env>

# Example: evaluate the default Hy-VLA checkpoint on stack_bowls.
bash eval.sh RoboDojo stack_bowls hyvla_dojo_ckpt_v3 arx_x5 ee 0 0 0 uv <eval_env_conda_env>
```

| `policy_server_port` | Port exposed by the policy server, for example `5000`. |
| `policy_server_host` | Server bind host, for example `0.0.0.0` on the policy machine. |
| `policy_server_ip` | IP or hostname that the environment client uses to reach the policy server. |
| `additional_info` | Comma-separated runtime labels passed to the eval client, for example `ckpt_name=...,action_type=ee`. |

```bash
cd XPolicyLab/policy/Hy_Embodied_05_VLA
# Terminal 1 on the policy machine: start the policy server.
bash setup_eval_policy_server.sh \
  <bench_name> <task_name> <ckpt_name> <env_cfg_type> <action_type> <seed> \
  <policy_gpu_id> <policy_uv_env> <policy_server_port> <policy_server_host>

# Example: bind the policy server to all interfaces on port 5000.
bash setup_eval_policy_server.sh \
  RoboDojo stack_bowls hyvla_dojo_ckpt_v3 arx_x5 ee 0 \
  0 uv 5000 0.0.0.0

# Terminal 2 on the environment machine: connect RoboDojo to the policy server.
bash setup_eval_env_client.sh \

  0 <eval_env_conda_env> "ckpt_name=hyvla_dojo_ckpt_v3,action_type=ee" \
  5000 <policy_server_ip>
```

Set `EVAL_ENV_TYPE=debug` for offline shape/IO checks when the adapter supports it; leave it unset or set `EVAL_ENV_TYPE=sim` for RoboDojo simulation.

Policy-specific `deploy.yml` keys worth checking before evaluation:

| Key | Notes |
|---|---|
| `policy_name` | Runtime or checkpoint option consumed by this adapter. |
| `hy_root` | Hy-Embodied source tree. Relative paths resolve against this policy directory; `$HY_VLA_ROOT` is used when this key is empty. |
| `ckpt_path` | Default checkpoint directory. Relative paths resolve against `hy_root`. |
| `norm_path` | Optional normalization stats path. Relative paths resolve against `hy_root`; empty uses `$HY_VLA_NORM_PATH`, then `<ckpt_path>/norm_stats.pkl`. |
| `with_absolute` | Runtime or checkpoint option consumed by this adapter. |
| `blend_mode` | Runtime or checkpoint option consumed by this adapter. |
| `exc_action_size` | Runtime or checkpoint option consumed by this adapter. |
| `exc_action_interval` | Runtime or checkpoint option consumed by this adapter. |
| `img_history_size` | Runtime or checkpoint option consumed by this adapter. |
| `img_history_interval` | Runtime or checkpoint option consumed by this adapter. |
| `policy_uv_env_path` | Runtime or checkpoint option consumed by this adapter. |

Frequently used environment variables detected in the adapter scripts:

| Variable | Notes |
|---|---|
| `CAM_HEAD` | Optional override used by the local scripts or upstream runtime. |
| `CAM_LEFT` | Optional override used by the local scripts or upstream runtime. |
| `CAM_RIGHT` | Optional override used by the local scripts or upstream runtime. |
| `CHIEF_IP` | Optional override used by the local scripts or upstream runtime. |
| `CKPT_NAME` | Optional override used by the local scripts or upstream runtime. |
| `CONDA_BASE` | Optional override used by the local scripts or upstream runtime. |
| `EVAL_ENV_TYPE` | Optional override used by the local scripts or upstream runtime. |
| `EXP_ID` | Optional override used by the local scripts or upstream runtime. |
| `EXP_ROOT` | Optional override used by the local scripts or upstream runtime. |
| `HDF5_DIR` | Optional override used by the local scripts or upstream runtime. |
| `HY_VLA_CKPT_PATH` | Optional override used by the local scripts or upstream runtime. |
| `HY_VLA_NORM_PATH` | Optional override for `norm_stats.pkl` when `deploy.yml` `norm_path` is empty. |
| `HY_VLA_ROOT` | Optional override for the Hy-Embodied source tree. |

## Notes

- Keep `ckpt_name` stable between data processing, training, and evaluation. For data-size ablations, encode the subset in `ckpt_name` such as `stack_bowls_50ep`.
- `task_name` is only the evaluation task; multi-task checkpoints can be evaluated on different tasks without renaming the checkpoint directory.
- Prefer running `setup_eval_policy_server.sh` and `setup_eval_env_client.sh` separately when debugging dependency, CUDA, or model-loading issues.
