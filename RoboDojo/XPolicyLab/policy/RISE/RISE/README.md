## 🔥 Highlights

<!-- RISE is a self-improving robot policy framework that turns world models into a practical learning environment for real-world manipulation. In short, we make the following three key contributions: -->

- **A compositional world model.**
A principled design that combines a controllable multi-view dynamics model with a progress value model, yielding informative advantages for robust policy improvement.
- **RL in imagination.**
A scalable self-improving framework that bootstraps robot policies through imaginary rollouts, avoiding the hardware cost and laborious reset of real-world interactions.
- **Real-world manipulation gains.**
Non-trivial performance improvements on challenging dexterous tasks, including +35% on dynamic brick sorting, +45% on backpack packing, and +35% on box closing.

## 🗺️ Overview

RISE repository is structured with three major parts:

- `policy_and_value/policy_offline_and_value`: OpenPI-based offline policy and value training. They are put together since they share similar model architecture and training pipeline.
- `dynamics/dynamics_model`: Action-conditioned dynamics model.
- `policy_and_value/policy_online`: Online RL for policy improvement.
